# TwitchLiveChecker
This Project checks a list of streamers, you choosed and check, if they're live and if they are, it will open the streamer in browser. Kinda like a bot

If you want to run the Python File to make changes or whatever, make sure to install all the libraries.
If you just want to use the programm open up start TwitchLiveChecker.

HOW TO RUN TWITCH-LIVE-CHECKER:
1. Run TwitchLiveChecker with Python:
   a. Install all libraries with install_libraries.bat or just manually
   b. open up TwitchLiveChecker.py
   c. you're good to go
2. Run TwitchLiveChecker without Python:
   a. Extract the ZIP-Folder and go to the Folder build and double klick the .exe file


WARNING:
1. The direct run without python doesn't get updates as often as the python-script does. It only updates every big update (e.g.: V1.0, V2.0, V3.0, â€¦)
   It doesn't get updates like the V1.1 or comming soon V1.2
2. Don't use the code as a bot. The code is more like a Podcast-Version of your favorite streamer. I do admit V2.0b looks highly suspicous like about, beacuse
   of the collecting channelpoints feature, but 1. you can turn of the feature and 2. you should turn this feature of if streamer doesn't want to, because you
   they give you rewards for watching their stream and not let a bot watch your stream and interact with it. The V2.1b Version also will get an update for
   made streamer, where I text streamer or they text me if I/they want to disable automatic-channelpoint collector. (I don't want to start a debate)

Current Versions:
V1.0  -> Early Access Code with bugs that I'm aware of (e.g.: When a streamer goes offline it doesn't close this tap, what could lead to pain for your ears)
V1.1  -> Early Access Code without bugs I'm aware of (Closes the unused tabs now)

Comming Soon:
V1.2  -> Early Access Code using CustomTkinter for better looking
V2.0a -> Non Early Access Code for direct run and non direct run, using CustomTkinter and searching if link is valid
V2.0b -> Early Access Code to collect channelpoints

Release Dates:
V1.0  -> 23.06.2024 - 23.06.2024 (released)
V1.1  -> 23.06.2024 - 23.06.2024 (released)
V1.2  -> 24.06.2024 - 09.09.2024 (making ideas)
V2.0a -> 24.06.2024 - 09.09.2024 (partly finished)
V2.0b -> 24.06.2024 - 31.12.2024 (not started yet)
